/**
 * @file hal_log.h
 * @brief ACE Log Hal defines the required API implmentations from the platform
 * to enable the ACE logging capability.
 * Definition of the terms:
 * *log buffer: a repository where logs with common log buffer ID are collected.
 * *log message: one text or binary log in the raw format without metadata.
 * *log entry: a log with meta datas such as timestamp, uid, tid.
 * @addtogroup ACE_HAL_LOG
 *
 * TARGET AUDIENCE
 * -----
 * This API document is written for platform developers who will implement @ref ACE_HAL_LOG HAL APIs
 *
 * HOW TO USE THE DOCUMENT
 * -----
 * The platform developer should read the @ref LOG_HAL_PORTING_GUIDE first for an overview and
 * then read the description of each API in @ref ACE_HAL_LOG for the implementation requirements
 *
 * OVERVIEW
 * -----
 * @ref ACE_HAL_LOG HAL APIs are declared in two header files.\n
 * hal_log.h includes APIs to support the core log writing and reading functions.\n
 * hal_log_bufferutil.h includes APIs to control platform buffer behaviors.\n
 * Support for writing text log using aceLogHal_write() is required for all platforms.
 * Support of other functions can be optional depending on the capability of the platform and
 * the need of the product. Please see the descriptions of individual APIs for detail.
 *
 * CODE EXAMPLES
 * -----
 * Stub implementations for @ref ACE_HAL_LOG HAL APIs are available as part of the ACS package.
 * Reference implementation for selective platforms may also be available. Please check
 * ACS reference implementation package for individual platforms.
 *
 * FAQ
 * -----
 * Q: Do all @ref ACE_HAL_LOG HAL APIs need to be supported?\n
 * A: Writing text log using aceLogHal_write() must be supported. Log reading
 * APIs and binary log writing API are not used by most products and are optional.
 * @ref HAL_LOG_BUFFERUTIL_APIs should be supported if it is appropriate for the platform.
